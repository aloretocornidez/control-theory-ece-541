books/materials to learn how to use MATLAB, the Modern Control System 
Theory and Design Toolbox or the various applications with this book.

Chapter 1

	Chapter 1 illustrates the concept of feedback and presents the 
status of practical applications of control systems, as it existed in 
1992.  Feedback control concepts are illustrated from the viewpoints of a 
positioning system for a missile launcher in Figure 1.9 on page 5, and in 
a manual control system where a human steers an automobile as illustrated 
in Figure 1.11 on page 6.

	Practical state-of-the-art applications of control systems to such 
fields as robotics (pages 7- 9), NASA space programs ( pages 8 - 12), 
rail transportation (pages 10 - 14), air transportation (pages 14- 18), 
military systems (pages 18- 22), surface effect ships and hydrofoils 
(pages 22- 23), biomedical control systems (pages 23- 25), and 
photographic automatic focus control systems (pages 25-26) are 
illustrated. 

	Section 1.6 (pages 27 - 29) contains Illustrative Problems and 
Solutions related to Chapter 1.

Chapter 2

	Chapter 2 develops the mathematical techniques needed by control 
engineers to analyze control systems from the classical Laplace 
transform/transfer function/block diagram and modern state variable 
viewpoints, and introduces MATLAB directly into the textbook.

	MATLAB is introduced directly into the presentation in Section 2.8 
starting on page 58. For those readers who are unfamiliar with MATLAB, it 
is suggested that they read Sections A through E of Section 2.8 before 
writing MATLAB programs. Table 2.2 on pages 72-73 summarizes commands and 
functions used by MATLAB. Table 2.3 on page 74 summarizes commands used 
by the Modern Control System Theory and Design Toolbox.

	Transfer functions of complex feedback functions are determined.
An illustration of using the classical Laplace transform/transfer 
function/block diagram reduction technique method applied to a complex 
feedback system is illustrated in Figure 2.11 on page 85.

	The same system illustrated in Figure 2.11 on page 85 is reduced 
very simply using Mason's theorem and signal flow graphs in Figure 2.18 
on page 93.

	The modern state variable method is developed.  It is applied in 
several ways in this chapter, including the development of an algorithm 
for determining the time response of a system which is shown in Eq. 2.248 
on page 122.

	The time response of the system shown in Fig 2.29 on page 113 to a 
unit step input is shown in Fig. 2.35 on page 126, and was obtained using 
the algorithm of Eq. 2.248 on page 122 with variable sampling times from 
0.05 to 0.5 seconds.

	The very useful state transition matrix is derived in Equation 2.256 
on page 130.  It is applied to finding the transition matrix of an open-
loop system whose transfer function is given by Eq. 2.266 on page 131, 
and the resulting state transition matrix is obtained and is given by Eq. 
2.275 on page 131.  From knowledge of this state transition matrix and 
the initial conditions given by Eq. 2.276 on page 132, the system's 
response is determined and illustrated in Figure 2.38 on page 132.

	Section 2.30 (page 142 - 158) contains Illustrative Problems and 
Solutions related to Chapter 2.

Chapter 3

	The state equation and the transfer-function representation of 
commonly used physical linear control system elements are derived in 
Chapter 3 for networks (Section 3.2 on pages 186 - 189), mechanical 
control-system devices (Section 3.3 on pages 189 - 195), 
electromechanical control-system devices (Section 3.4 on pages 195 - 
213), hydraulic devices (Section 3.5 on pages 213 to 219), and thermal 
systems (Section 3.6 on pages 219 to 221).  A very useful generalized 
approach for modeling using the principles of conservation and analogy 
are presented in Section 3.7 on pages 221 - 224). 

	Section 3.8 (pages 224 - 227) contains Illustrative Problems and 
Solutions related to Chapter 3.

Chapter 4

	Second-order control systems are derived and analyzed in Chapter 4. 
 The response of the second-order control system illustrated in Figure 
4.1 is determined for a unit step input.  Depending on the value of the 
damping ratio (zeta), a critically damped (Figure 4.2a on page 243), 
over-damped (Figure 4.2b), or under-damped (Figure 4.2c) transient output 
response is obtained.

	The transient response of an underdamped second-order control system 
is determined in Eq. 4.24 on page 245, and the effect of various damping 
factors is illustrated in Figure 4.4 on page 248.  The percent maximum 
overshoot of an underdamped second-order control system as a function of 
several damping factor variations is illustrated in Figure 4.5 on page 
249.

	The complete response of a second-order control system using the 
state-variable-signal-flow diagram method is obtained in Section 4.3 
(pages 248 - 252).  This approach obtains the complete solution of the 
system response consisting of the particular solution due to an external 
unit step input (which is the same response as Eq. 4.24 on page 245), and 
also the homogeneous solution due to the initial conditions of the two 
system states.

	Guidelines for the "best" damping ratio to use in a particular 
control system are presented in Section 4.5 on pages 252 - 255.

	The procedure for modeling a transfer function from test data is 
illustrated in Section 4.6 (pages 255 - 260).

	Section 4.7 (pages 260 - 261) contains Illustrative Problems and 
Solutions related to Chapter 4.

Chapter 5

	The advantages of control systems are developed in Chapter 5, where 
the desirable sensitivity (Section 5.3 on pages 273 - 277) and accuracy 
characteristics (Section 5.4 on pages 277 - 288) are developed.

	The use of performance indices for governing the design of control 
systems is presented in Section 5.6 on pages 290 - 292.  The use and 
application of the integral of time multiplied by the absolute value of 
error (ITAE) performance index is presented in Section 5.8 on pages  
294 - 295.

	Section 5.10 (pages 296 - 307) contains Illustrative Problems and 
Solutions related to Chapter 5.

Chapter 6

	Methods for the analysis of control system stability are developed 
in Chapter 6.  To illustrate the importance of the location of the system 
poles on stability, Figure 6.2 on page 334 shows three very different 
second-order systems and their different time-domain responses:

a)	S1 represents the case of a system which has a pair of complex 
conjugate poles in the left-half-plane and its response is an 
exponentially damped sinusoid.
b)	S2 represents the case of a system which has a pair of complex 
conjugate poles in the right-half-plane and its response is an 
exponentially growing sinusoid.
c)	S3 represents the case of a system which has a pair of complex 
conjugate poles on the imaginary axis and its response is an 
oscillation of fixed amplitude.

	The following stability analysis methods are developed in this 
chapter:

	1)	Routh-Hurwitz (Section 6.3 on pages 340 - 344)
	2)	Nyquist Diagram (Section 6.5 on pages 349 - 359); Section 6.4  
           (pages 344 - 349) first introduces the concept of mapping 	
	contours from the s-plane to the F(s)-plane. The procedure for 	
	obtaining the Nyquist diagram using MATLAB is illustrated in 	
	Section 6.6 (pages 359 - 362).
	3)	Bode Diagram (Section 6.7 on pages 362 - 380). Section 6.8 
(pages 		380 - 385) illustrates the procedure for obtaining the 
Bode               diagram using MATLAB. Section 6.9 (pages 386 - 398) 
develops a 		program in FORTRAN and BASIC for obtaining the Bode 
diagram, the 		closed-loop frequency response, and the transient 
response for 		those readers who don't have MATLAB. (It contains the 
logic flow 		diagram, listing, and output for an illustrative 
example.) 
	4)	Nichols Chart (Section 6.10 on pages 398 - 403). Section 6.11 
		(pages 403 - 405) illustrates the procedure for obtaining the 
		Nichols Chart using MATLAB.
	5)	Root Locus Method for Negative Feedback Systems (Section 6.14 
		on 		pages 409 - 431); the Root Locus for Positive 
Feedback Systems 		(Section 6.16 (pages 434 - 437). Section 6.17 
(pages 437 - 442) 		illustrates the procedure for obtaining the root 
locus using 		MATLAB. Section 6.18 (pages 443 - 454) develops a 
program in 		FORTRAN IV for obtaining the root locus for those 
readers who 		don't have MATLAB. (It contains the logic flow 
diagram, listing, 		and output for an illustrative example.)

	Figure 6.10 on page 352 illustrates the general procedure for 
obtaining the Nyquist diagram for the system whose characteristic 
equation is given by Eq. 6.62 on page 351.

	A representative Bode diagram (including phase margin and gain 
margin) of a unity-feedback control system whose forward transfer 
function is given by Eq. 6.99 (page 375) is shown in Fig. 6.31 (page 
376).

	The Nichols chart is applied to analyze the stability of the control 
system shown in Figure 6.49 (page 402), and the resulting Nichols chart 
is illustrated in Fig. 6.51(a) (page 404).  Additionally, the closed loop 
frequency response is obtained from this Nichols chart, and it is 
illustrated in Fig. 6.51(b) on page 404.

	The construction of the root locus for negative-feedback control 
systems is developed in Section 6.14 on pages 409 - 431.  The root locus 
of a representative control system containing a pure integrator and two 
simple poles is illustrated in Fig. 6.57 (page 414).  Several MODERN 
CONTROL SYSTEM THEORY AND DESIGN TOOLBOX functions are used to obtain 
this root locus: a) The calculation of rule 4 (real axis part of the root 
locus) is accommodated by the function rlaxis.  b) The calculation of 
rule 7 (breakaway and break-in points) is accommodated by the function 
rlpoba.  c) The calculation of rule 8 (root locus intersection with the 
imaginary axis) is accommodated by the function rootangl.

	The construction of the root locus for positive-feedback control 
systems is developed in Section 6.16 on pages 434 - 437.

	An interesting root locus example is illustrated in Figure 6.67 on 
page 437 where the root locus for both negative and positive feedback are 
illustrated on the same set of axes for a control system which has a pure 
integrator, three simple poles, and one simple zero.

	The very interesting Table 6.27 is shown on pages 457 - 459 where a 
comparison is made of using the Nyquist diagram, Bode diagram, Nichols 
chart, and root locus diagram to analyze the same twelve commonly used 
transfer functions.

	Guidelines for selecting the best stability method to use for 
analyzing a particular linear control system are presented in Section 
6.22 on pages 463 - 464.

	Section 6.23 (pages 464 - 476) contains Illustrative Problems and 
Solutions related to Chapter 6.	

Chapter 7

In Chapter 6, the only objective that we answered was to determine how 
stable or unstable the system was.  We made no attempt to make the system 
more stable if it were only marginally stable, or to make it stable if it 
were unstable.  The application of the stability analysis techniques 
presented in Chapter 6 to the design of linear systems is presented in 
Chapter 7.  In addition to certain stability requirements, the systems 
designed in Chapter 7 also have simultaneous accuracy requirements.  The 
design in Chapter 7 includes the use of the Bode diagram, Nichols Chart, 
and root-locus methods.  In addition, the concept of linear-state-
variable feedback, controllability, and observability are presented.  
Estimator design, and the combined compensator design using a controller 
and an estimator are presented.    

   The design of a control system containing a disturbance, U(s), is 
illustrated in Figure 7.27 on page 536.  A gain of K = 9.55 is required 
to limit the effect of a unit step disturbance so that the resulting 
steady-state error is 0.1.  For stability design purposes, a minimum 
phase margin of 20 degrees and a minimum gain margin of 6 dB are 
required.  Figure 7.28 on page 537 shows the resulting Bode diagrams on 
the same set of axes for the marginally-stable uncompensated and  stable 
compensated systems.

	Figure 7.37 on page 551 shows the compensated version of the Nichols 
chart for the system shown originally in Figure 6.49, and whose Nichols 
chart was originally shown in Figure 6.51(a).  A compensation network has 
been added to the system so that the value of the maximum peaking in the 
frequency domain is reduced from 6.758 dB in Figure 6.51(b) to 2.976 dB 
in Figure 7.37.

	Figure 7.39 on page 558 shows the compensation on the root locus 
diagram for the system originally shown in Figure 6.57 on page 414. The 
compensated system achieves a velocity constant of 30/sec in addition to 
a damping factor of 0.707.

	Extensive tradeoff considerations for using various cascade-
compensation methods (phase-lag, phase-lead, and phase-lag-lead networks) 
and the use of minor-loop feedback are contained in Table 7.2 on pages 
568 and 569.

Chapter 8

	Chapter 8 presents the major techniques used in modern control 
system design. These include state-space, pole placement, Ackermann's 
formula, estimation, robust control, and HÑ techniques. These are very 
powerful methods for designing control systems

	Figure 8.8 on page 600 illustrates an example of a linear-state-
variable feedback system containing a controller and a process.  An 
estimator system using linear-state-variable feedback is illustrated in 
Figure 7.46 on page 469.  

	After introducing Controllability in Section 8.4 on pages 605 - 608, 
and Observability in Section 8.5 on pages 609 - 611, Ackermann's formula 
for design using pole placement is presented in Section 8.6 starting on 
page 611. Ackermann's technique is very useful for control systems which 
require feedback from state variables which are not phase variables, that 
is, where each subsequent state variable is defined as the derivative of 
the previous state variable. Ackermann's method simplifies this problem 
by transforming the control system to phase variables, determining the 
feedback gains, and transforming the designed control system to its 
original state-variable representation. This approach is applied to the 
control system illustrated in Figure 8.16 on page 614. 

	A combined compensator design including a controller and an 
estimator is illustrated in Figure 8.19 on page 621. 

	Robust control systems are introduced in Section 8.10 starting on 
page 630. Robust control systems are concerned with determining a 
stabilizing controller that achieves feedback performance in terms of 
stability and accuracy requirements, but the control must achieve the 
performance that is robust (insensitive) to plant uncertainty, parameter 
variation, and external disturbances. A design example is illustrated for 
the system shown in Figure 8.23 on page 631. 

	The important modern approach to control system design using HÑ 
concepts is presented in Sections 8.11 and 8.12 starting on page 636. 
This approach combines both the frequency- and time-domain approaches to 
provide a unified answer. The presentation expands the concepts of 
robustness (introduced in Section 8.10) and sensitivity (introduced in 
Chapter 5), together with the frequency and state-variable domain 
techniques to introduce the HÑ concepts and apply it to some design 
problems.

Answers to Selected Problems

	Answers to approximately one third of the problems in the book are
